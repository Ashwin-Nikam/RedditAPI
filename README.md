# RedditAPI
Simple API for Reddit built using BeautifulSoup and Flask in Python. 

## Initial Setup
* Make sure you have python3 installed.
* Now we install pip as it makes it easier to download the latest version of Django globally. Execute the following command.
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
* Now we install a virtual environment using pip3
```
$ sudo pip3 install virtualenv 
```

## Running the server
* Clone this repo and cd into it.
```
$ git clone <this-repo>
$ cd <this-repo>
```
* Run the virtual environment
```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
